Plasma is a system that can solve the scalability problem of the Ethereum network and ensure the volume of transactions comparable to centralized systems such as Visa and Mastercard. Plasma is a separate unit with high performance, plus a smart contract system that connects it to the main Ethereum network. This makes it possible to combine the advantages of distributed systems such as the absence of intermediaries and the reliability of transactions with the high speed and low commission of centralized systems.
