The "Open Charity" project will create a service for donations and charity with transparent transactions, where anyone can define the conditions via smart contract (such as the goals that the money is intended to fund) and monitor their execution. From a technical point of view, for the moment Open Charity is a money transfer system of tokens within the charity with additional rules (trust system for using amounts of a certain size, tags for different purposes of charity). For the future, the function of checking target expenditures is planned.
