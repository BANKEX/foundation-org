BANKEX Foundation aims to bring together a crypto-community that builds and develops effective open-source solutions in collaboration. We invite companies and enterprises that share our values and goals to participate, develop our technology and find new ways to apply it.

&nbsp;

Members of the alliance receive priority access to our resources: we provide technical support, adjust our solutions to meet the members' needs and specific tasks, contribute to their projects and draw the attention of our community to the work they are doing.
