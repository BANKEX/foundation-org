                        .description The "Open Charity" project will create a service for donations and charity with transparent transactions, where anyone can define the conditions via smart contract (such as the goals that the money is intended to fund) and monitor their execution. From a technical point of view, for the moment Open Charity is a money transfer system of tokens within the charity with additional rules (trust system for using amounts of a certain size, tags for different purposes of charity). For the future, the function of checking target expenditures is planned

                            | We hope that about 5000 people will join them by the end of 2018. Also, throughout the year we are going to publish articles designed to explain cutting edge topics blockchain in simple words, and organize webinars aimed to help those who have just started their educational process to get the grasp of the blockchain technology

                        .description Plasma is a system that can solve the scalability problem of the Ethereum network and ensure the volume of transactions comparableto centralized systems such as Visa and Mastercard. Plasma is a separate unit with high performance, plus a smart contract system that connects it to the main Ethereum network. This makes it possible to combine the advantages of distributed systems such as the absence of intermediaries and the reliability of transactions with the high speed and low commission of centralized systems

                        .description First and only up-to-date implementation of the Web3 protocol for interacting with smart contracts via mobile devices. Bankex Foundation has long-term plans for Web3swift development such as browser integration for full support of Dapps and integration with light client for the Ethereum network itself, so that a mobile device is a stand-alone member of the network. We believe that an iOS device with the latest firmware, security updates anddevice encryption is the best and the most convenient way for end users to store their funds and quickly and seamlessly interact with Ethereum
